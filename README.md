crowdemotion-api-js
====================

CrowdEmotion RESTful API client for Javascript.

This is intended as a very simple implementation example.

====================

To try some basic functions (authentication and video file upload), just open the file `test_upload.html` directly within the browser and try to upload an MP4 file (tested with Chrome and Firefox).

A very quick solution for opening it through HTTP protocol could be writing in a terminal:

```
$ cd crowdemotion-api-js
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then opening [http://localhost:8000/tests/test_upload.html](http://localhost:8000/tests/test_upload.html).
