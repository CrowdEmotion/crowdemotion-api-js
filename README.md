crowdemotion-api-js
====================

CrowdEmotion RESTful API client for Javascript.

This is intended as a very simple implementation example.


## Quick Start

To try some basic functions (authentication and video file upload), just open the file `test_upload.html` directly within the browser and try to upload an MP4 file (tested with Chrome and Firefox).

A very quick way for opening it through HTTP protocol is writing in a terminal:

```
$ cd crowdemotion-api-js
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then opening [http://localhost:8000/tests/test_upload.html](http://localhost:8000/tests/test_upload.html).

### Using the dashboard

Also you can use the file dashboard.html to view results [http://crowdemotion.github.io/crowdemotion-api-js/tests/dashboard.html](http://crowdemotion.github.io/crowdemotion-api-js/tests/dashboard.html)
